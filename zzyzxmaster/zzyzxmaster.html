     <b> {P} {SP} (Control) </b> <br> 
    By: Zzyzx_Master <br> 
Cost: |60100|Expensive <br> 
Notable cards: blaucher, tricarrotops, poppies, wnb <br> 
Game plan: For the first turns try to control them, however don't hesitate to get some tempo by setting up tricarrotops or pear cub (when it dies to make grizzly ofc). Against control decks you should put some pressure but don't overcommit. Your main finisher is suprising wnb shot (or two) but it's nice if you get some damage ealier or when your tricarrotops manages to grow enough to be a treat.

<h1> Aggro Swarm </h1>

<p class="dashed"> 
  <b> {Z} {EB} (Aggro) </b> <br> 
  By: Zzyzx <br> Master <br>
  Cost: |45850| Expensive  <br> 
Notable cards: conman, aerobics, fruitcake <br> 
Game plan: just simply agroo. Literally 75% of your cards are 1 and 2 drops, so you always should have a play and at the same time almost all those cards are tempo treats with potential to do ton of damage each. Quasars give you often useful superpowers. Bungee and fruitcake open you lanes. Then jester and loudmouth are 2 gravestones your opponent can confuse and front wrong minion. Area 22 gives so much value and in case games go longer and you run out of fuel there's emergency maniacal laugh.

<h1> Bouncing Beans </h1> 
<img src="/zzyzxmaster/bouncingbeans.jpg" alt="Zzyzx_Master's Bouncing Beans Decklist" width="914" height="926"> 
<p class="dashed">
  <b> {P} {CT} (Tempo) </b> <br> 
  By: Zzyzx <br> Master <br> 
  Cost: |50550| Expensive <br> 
Notable cards: anb, tricarrotops, jelly bean, brainana <br> 
Game plan: You slowly develop tempo on early game, on turns 3,4,5 you try to bounce/freeze their answer so your early game cards survives. You grow more and more tempo and deal damage to face (especially using anb) while denying your opponent's tempo. Later brainana also helps with your opponent not being able to respond. Rescue radish despite buffing jelly bean has some synergy with cosmic bean, cool bean and brainana but it's kinda anti-tempo so better save it for later.
</p> 
<h1> Control Cap </h1> 
<img src="/zzyzxmaster/controlcap.jpg" alt="Zzyzx_Master's Control Cap Decklist" width="774" height="925">
<p class="dashed"> 
  <b> {P} {NC} (Control/Mid) </b> <br> 
  By: Zzyzx_Master <br> 
  Cost: |68350| Expensive <br> 
Notable cards: blaucher, shrinking, brainana, dmd <br> 
Game plan: On early game you have a lot of control options to use. Try to answer all treats. Sportacus is quite nice against more control matchups. If you face one, other than sportacus you shouldn't develop anything unless it answers treats till turn 5. On later game try to develop birb, answer pass with brainana, clear field in emergency with kernel corn. Finally you have dmd which can both answer tricks and clear field.
</p> 
<h1> Control Gargs </h1> 
<img src="/zzyzxmaster/controlgargs.jpg" alt="Zzyzx_Master's Control Gargs Decklist" width="828" height="900"> 
<p class="dashed"> 
<b> {Z} {EB} (Control) </b> <br> 
By: Zzyzx<br> Master <br> 
Cost: |67900| Expensive <br> 
Notable cards: barrel, hunting grounds, gti, gtg <br> 
Game plan: in the first couple of turns you play it as a standard control deck. Then if you have gti or gtg it's nice to set up hunting grounds turn ealier for the synergy. Fireworks and barrel-fm combo are great to guarantee making more gargs. Finally you have gas giant for solid direct damage to face and to provide even more splash.
</p> 
<h1> Dandy Miracle </h1> 
<img src="/zzyzxmaster/dandy.jpg" alt="zzyzxmaster's Dandy Miracle Decklist" width="828" height="892"> 
<p class="dashed"> 
  <b> {P} {SF} (Miracle) </b> <br> 
  By: Zzyzx Master <br> 
  Cost: |53200| Expensive <br> 
Notable cards: astro, imitator, pair pearadise, pineclone, dandy <br> 
Game plan: Stall for first couple turns using bblast and ketchup, on right moment you can use primal sunflower to ramp. Try to not ping blockmeter. If you have dandy combo, set up imitator and environment turn ealier, otherwise make pineclone combo. After successful dandy combo finish em with sonic blooms and astros. 
</p> 
<h1> Healzilla </h1> 
<img src="/zzyzxmaster/healzilla.jpg" alt="Zzyzx_Master's Healzilla Decklist" width="910" height="925"> 
<p class="dashed"> 
  <b> {P} {CZ} (Heal Tempo) </b> <br> 
  By: Zzyzx <br> Master <br> 
  Cost: |37550| Normalish <br> 
Notable cards: Pepper MD, heartichoke, venus flytraplanet, rings <br> 
Game plan: On the early game if you're facing agroo control them, if against control: pass (but play black-eyed-pea) if deck is not any of them, usually pass but remove treats before opponent gets too much tempo. On turns 3,4,5 you can start developing more tempo (elderberry, pepper md combo, ketchup) unless you have rings and can afford waiting till turn 5. Later in the game finish them using army of 4/4s and heal combos.
</p>
<h1> Mustache Aggro </h1> 
<img src="/zzyzxmaster/mustaggro.jpg"  alt="zzyzxmasterÂ´s Mustache Aggro Decklist" width="828" height="883">
<p class="dashed"> 
  <b> {Z} {PB} (Aggro) </b> <br> 
  By: Zzyzx_Master <br> 
  Cost: |66300| Expensive <br> 
Notable cards: bungee, mustache waxer, quasar, duckstache <br> 
Game plan: it's agroo deck that uses potential of crazy package but at the same time mustache synergy: particularly with mustache waxer. On turn 1 it's better to play conman, but on turn 2 you can already start using awesome synergy of mustache waxer with crazy 1-drops: grobber and bungee. Your opponent shouldn't be able to respond to 2/3 or 2/4 and your agressive 1-drop so then you can get more value of synergies: one also really strong is with quasar. Develop your agressive tempo and later evolve duckstache. To finish your opponent teleport viking or just kill them with the help of sugary treat.
</p> 
<h1> Pirates </h1> 
<img src="/zzyzxmaster/pirates.jpg" alt="Zzyzx_Master's Pirates Decklist" width="924" height="926"> 
<p class="dashed"> 
  <b> {Z} {SB} (Aggro) </b> <br> 
  By: Zzyzx<br> Master <br> 
  Cost: |39850| Expensive <br> 
Notable cards: headstone carver, swash, flameface, cowboy <br> 
Game play: typical pirate synergy agroo (agressive tempo?) deck. On turn 1 it's nice to set up carver but just in case you have agroo option - chimney sweep. On next turns you try to get grave and/or curve to get damage and tempo advantage. Stealthy imp and viking while not great cards themselves, they do a ton of damage paired with smoke bomb, bonus attack or sb's sig. Besides that you have cowboy as a more consistent finisher.
</p> 
<h1> PodFighter Swarm </h1> 
<img src="/zzyzxmaster/podfighterswarm.jpg" alt="zzyzxmaster's PodFighter Swarm Decklist" width="908" height="926"> 
<p class="dashed"> 
  <b> {P} {CC} (Miracle Swarm)</b> <br> 
  By: Zzyzx<br> Master <br> 
  Cost: |40450| Expensive  <br> 
Notable cards: astro, rings, pod-fighter <br> 
Game plan: On early game against control you pass and wait for combo with pod-fighter or rings. If they develop some tempo you can also develop yours using synergies between swarm, environments and mutation. Against agroo try to not fall behind and answer things using your own cards. On later game either make huge swarm (with or without rings) paired with tempo tricks/environments or finish them with pod-fighter combo.
</p> 
<h1> StompaTrickster </h1> 
<img src="/zzyzxmaster/stompatrickster.jpg" alt="zzyzxmaster's StompaTrcikster Decklist" width="914" height="926"> 
<p class="dashed"> 
  <b> {Z} {RB} (Miracle) </b> <br> 
  By: Zzyzx<br> Master <br> 
  Cost: |57050| Expensive <br> 
Notable cards: teleport, stomadon, trickster <br>
Game plan: You stall for the first turns so it's nice to have one trickster in hand. To help you not fall far behind you have rolling stone, cader and sumo and to develop tempo quicker, use cryo-brain. On turn 5 you either teleport suprise stompadon or play it with manager to get value. Then you protect it and try to get as much value as possible with help of fun-dead-raiser and going viral. If you don't get stompadon and you start to get out-tempo'd use paparazzi-teacher-going viral synergies to also buff your trickster. Finish them with buffed 1-drops and tricksters.
</p> 
<h1> Swarm Sports </h1> 
<img src="/zzyzxmaster/swarmsports.jpg" alt="Zzyzx_Master's Swarm Sports Decklist" width="910" height="927"> 
<p class="dashed"> 
  <b> {Z} {SM} (Tempo) </b> <br> 
  By: Zzyzx<br> Master <br> 
  Cost: |20900| Normal <br> 
Notable cards: teacher, flag, going viral, mascot <br> 
Game plan: with this deck you have a couple of ways to play. If you get flag with a bunch of 1 drops you pass t1 and swarm them on turn 2 (it gets even better with teacher). If you don't get one try to go for sports tempo curve. Genetic experiment puts additional pressure and teacher helps you flip trades and with going viral provide insane value. Later you can use primeval yeti and swimmer to simply out-tempo your opponent.
</p> 
<h1> TempoImps </h1> 
<img src="/zzyzxmaster/tempoimps.jpg" alt="Zzyzx_Master's TempoImps Decklist" width="916" height="925"> 
<p class="dashed"> 
  <b> {Z} {BF} (Tempo) </b> <br> 
  By: Zzyzx<br> Master <br> 
  Cost: |41650| Expensive  <br> 
Notable cards: iti, toxic waste, commander, cowboy <br> 
Game plan: use imps synergy to take over the board. Very important cards to help you do that are toxic waste, well-placed iti and later imp commander. You also have a bunch of support cards to manipulate trades: smoke bomb, area 22, loudmouth. Those also synergize very well with cowboy and commander's ability. Botanist is nice to front iti or cowboy. Pogo and line dancing let you deal more damage, finally maniacal laugh should finish longer games.
</p>
<h1> Viral Pirates </h1>
<img src="/zzyzxmaster/viralpirates.jpg" alt="Zzyzx_Master's Tempo Imps Decklist" width="910" height="925"> 
<p class="dashed"> 
  <b> {Z} {NT} (Tempo<br> aggro) </b> <br> 
  By: Zzyzx<br> Master <br> 
  Cost: |28900| Normalish <br> 
Notable cards: headstone carver, swash, flameface, going viral <br> 
Game plan: carver or agressive octo-pult on 1. Then you have variety of 2-costing graves to synergize with carver and confuse your opponent. Same number of options on turn 3. Use grave and pirate synergy to take over the board, support your cards using tricks, especially going viral. Cowboy is your one card finisher and it gets insane value with any of your tricks.
