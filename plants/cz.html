     <b> {P} [CZ] (Tempo) Ringzilla </b> <br> 
By: Sushi and William <br>
Cost: 30250 <br> 
Anti DB ringzilla, extra plant food to beat control and force more respect from science and graves. No brex due to many bolts and fruitcakes, and reduced synergy with plant food. Kernel pult pings off key midgame threats, 2/1s, and finishes trades.

<p class="dashed"> 
  <b> {P} {CZ} (Heal Tempo) </b> <br> 
  By: Zzyzx_Master <br> 
  Cost: |37550| Normalish <br> 
Notable cards: Pepper MD, heartichoke, venus flytraplanet, rings <br> 
Game plan: On the early game if you're facing agroo control them, if against control: pass (but play black-eyed-pea) if deck is not any of them, usually pass but remove treats before opponent gets too much tempo. On turns 3,4,5 you can start developing more tempo (elderberry, pepper md combo, ketchup) unless you have rings and can afford waiting till turn 5. Later in the game finish them using army of 4/4s and heal combos.
