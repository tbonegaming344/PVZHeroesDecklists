 <b>  {P} [GK] (Tempo) Savage </b> <br>
By: TheRegster, Sushi <br> 
Cost: if you are worried about how much this deck costs, you can't afford it. <br> 

Doubled mint scales early very quickly, can scale late due to spinach, and if they try holding plumber etc. We punish them with jugger/trica turn 2 so that's not an option to them. <br> 

Why is 3nut not in this deck:  <br> 
- 3nut is a (more) powerful card <br> 
- 3nut is a more powerful card in other decks, but not this one. <br> 
- 3nut is a card that requires buildaround (6-7 garlic/wall nuts, along with appropriate 1-2 drops) <br> 
- 3nut requires that you have a good, renewable or at least reliable way of keeping the board clear until opponents commit t3 or going into t4-5 <br> 

cucc: <br> 
- creates midgame and late game <br> 
- significantly benefits by having his weakness to debuffs covered by savage before and after he is played <br> 
- suffers from a lack of lethality that is provided from the threat of our scaling 2 drops and bullseye chip <br> 
- importantly, has no requirements for holding back or anything. We can play in the most powerful way to supporting spinach (destroying opposing tempo on board while developing our own) even without spinach because both spinach and cucc want us to create a board that either scales with spinach or threatens opponents away from being able to deal with cucc. <br> 

The deck's wincon tends to be killing people with insanely good scaling earlygame + spinach, <br>  but when you don't draw spinach, it's also completely fine to have scaling 2 drops + cucc to force an ultimatum on opponents. <br> 3nut could not accomplish this, because it wants us to play in a different way, and also has a kind of value we already have (create efficient threats) while also requiring we do a number of other things <br>
