  <b> {P} {CC} (Miracle Swarm)</b> <br> 
  By: Zzyzx_Master <br> 
  Cost: |40450| Expensive  <br> 
Notable cards: astro, rings, pod-fighter <br> 
Game plan: On early game against control you pass and wait for combo with pod-fighter or rings. If they develop some tempo you can also develop yours using synergies between swarm, environments and mutation. Against agroo try to not fall behind and answer things using your own cards. On later game either make huge swarm (with or without rings) paired with tempo tricks/environments or finish them with pod-fighter combo.
