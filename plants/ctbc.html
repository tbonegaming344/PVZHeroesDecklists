<img src="/zzyzxmaster/bouncingbeans.jpg" alt="Zzyzx_Master's Bouncing Beans Decklist" width="914" height="926"> 
<p class="dashed">
  <b> {P} {CT} (Tempo) </b> <br> 
  By: Zzyzx_Master <br> 
  Cost: |50550| Expensive <br> 
Notable cards: anb, tricarrotops, jelly bean, brainana <br> 
Game plan: You slowly develop tempo on early game, on turns 3,4,5 you try to bounce/freeze their answer so your early game cards survives. You grow more and more tempo and deal damage to face (especially using anb) while denying your opponent's tempo. Later brainana also helps with your opponent not being able to respond. Rescue radish despite buffing jelly bean has some synergy with cosmic bean, cool bean and brainana but it's kinda anti-tempo so better save it for later.
