Cost: |3800 | Not a good deck don't play this deck I'm not kidding you'll regret it. Just queuing into a game will result in not only a loss in-game, but tossing one's phone into your window. The resulting glass shards will blind you, causing you to go to the emergency room. Once you're in the hospital, your stretcher will fall over and you'll break your neck.

Notable cards: blaucher, shrinking, brainana, dmd <br> 
Game plan: On early game you have a lot of control options to use. Try to answer all treats. Sportacus is quite nice against more control matchups. If you face one, other than sportacus you shouldn't develop anything unless it answers treats till turn 5. On later game try to develop birb, answer pass with brainana, clear field in emergency with kernel corn. Finally you have dmd which can both answer tricks and clear field.

     <b> {P} {SP} (Control) </b> <br> 
    By: Zzyzx_Master <br> 
Cost: |60100|Expensive <br> 
Notable cards: blaucher, tricarrotops, poppies, wnb <br> 
Game plan: For the first turns try to control them, however don't hesitate to get some tempo by setting up tricarrotops or pear cub (when it dies to make grizzly ofc). Against control decks you should put some pressure but don't overcommit. Your main finisher is suprising wnb shot (or two) but it's nice if you get some damage ealier or when your tricarrotops manages to grow enough to be a treat.
