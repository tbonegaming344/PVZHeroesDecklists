  <b> {Z} {EB} (Aggro<br> swarm) </b> <br> 
  By: Zzyzx<br> Master <br>
  Cost: |45850| Expensive  <br> 
Notable cards: conman, aerobics, fruitcake <br> 
Game plan: just simply agroo. Literally 75% of your cards are 1 and 2 drops, so you always should have a play and at the same time almost all those cards are tempo treats with potential to do ton of damage each. Quasars give you often useful superpowers. Bungee and fruitcake open you lanes. Then jester and loudmouth are 2 gravestones your opponent can confuse and front wrong minion. Area 22 gives so much value and in case games go longer and you run out of fuel there's emergency maniacal laugh.

<h1> PodFighter Swarm </h1>

<p class="dashed"> 
  <b> {P} {CC} (Miracle Swarm)</b> <br> 
  By: Zzyzx_Master <br> 
  Cost: |40450| Expensive  <br> 
Notable cards: astro, rings, pod-fighter <br> 
Game plan: On early game against control you pass and wait for combo with pod-fighter or rings. If they develop some tempo you can also develop yours using synergies between swarm, environments and mutation. Against agroo try to not fall behind and answer things using your own cards. On later game either make huge swarm (with or without rings) paired with tempo tricks/environments or finish them with pod-fighter combo.
