Anti DB ringzilla, extra plant food to beat control and force more respect from science and graves. No brex due to many bolts and fruitcakes, and reduced synergy with plant food. Kernel pult pings off key midgame threats, 2/1s, and finishes trades.

<p class="dashed">
 <b>  {P} [GK] (Tempo) Savage </b> <br>
By: TheRegster, Sushi <br> 
Cost: if you are worried about how much this deck costs, you can't afford it. <br> 

Doubled mint scales early very quickly, can scale late due to spinach, and if they try holding plumber etc. We punish them with jugger/trica turn 2 so that's not an option to them. <br> 

Why is 3nut not in this deck:  <br> 
- 3nut is a (more) powerful card <br> 
- 3nut is a more powerful card in other decks, but not this one. <br> 
- 3nut is a card that requires buildaround (6-7 garlic/wall nuts, along with appropriate 1-2 drops) <br> 
- 3nut requires that you have a good, renewable or at least reliable way of keeping the board clear until opponents commit t3 or going into t4-5 <br> 

cucc: <br> 
- creates midgame and late game <br> 
- significantly benefits by having his weakness to debuffs covered by savage before and after he is played <br> 
- suffers from a lack of lethality that is provided from the threat of our scaling 2 drops and bullseye chip <br> 
- importantly, has no requirements for holding back or anything. We can play in the most powerful way to supporting spinach (destroying opposing tempo on board while developing our own) even without spinach because both spinach and cucc want us to create a board that either scales with spinach or threatens opponents away from being able to deal with cucc. <br> 

The deck's wincon tends to be killing people with insanely good scaling earlygame + spinach, <br>  but when you don't draw spinach, it's also completely fine to have scaling 2 drops + cucc to force an ultimatum on opponents. <br> 3nut could not accomplish this, because it wants us to play in a different way, and also has a kind of value we already have (create efficient threats) while also requiring we do a number of other things <br>

Notable cards: Cheesecutter, Monkey Smuggler, Area 22, Cryo Yeti <br>
Main Goal: Since we're playing into discordtards, cheesecutter will usually not get fronted. Now we can use that free value to put more extra tempo on the field and prevent their tempo with cyborg. With monkey smuggler you make sure they don't benefit from the blockcharge and potentially bait out some grave removal, which would win them the game later. Finish the game with either a cryo yeti combo, or a combination of strikethrough and frenzy.

   By: YOYO <br> 
Cost: |61,200|Expensive <br> 
Notable cards:IDZ,Trick or Treater <br> 
Gameplan: use your teleportation zombie with your one drops for a great tempo strategy then buff them with healthy treat and going viral and have some power with bonus attacks, trick or treater helps that strategy while also giving us cards to play instead of nothing

  <b> {P} {CT} (Tempo) </b> <br> 
  By: Zzyzx_Master <br> 
  Cost: |50550| Expensive <br> 
Notable cards: anb, tricarrotops, jelly bean, brainana <br> 
Game plan: You slowly develop tempo on early game, on turns 3,4,5 you try to bounce/freeze their answer so your early game cards survives. You grow more and more tempo and deal damage to face (especially using anb) while denying your opponent's tempo. Later brainana also helps with your opponent not being able to respond. Rescue radish despite buffing jelly bean has some synergy with cosmic bean, cool bean and brainana but it's kinda anti-tempo so better save it for later.

  <b> {P} {CZ} (Heal Tempo) </b> <br> 
  By: Zzyzx_Master <br> 
  Cost: |37550| Normalish <br> 
Notable cards: Pepper MD, heartichoke, venus flytraplanet, rings <br> 
Game plan: On the early game if you're facing agroo control them, if against control: pass (but play black-eyed-pea) if deck is not any of them, usually pass but remove treats before opponent gets too much tempo. On turns 3,4,5 you can start developing more tempo (elderberry, pepper md combo, ketchup) unless you have rings and can afford waiting till turn 5. Later in the game finish them using army of 4/4s and heal combos.

  <b> {Z} {SM} (Tempo) </b> <br> 
  By: Zzyzx_Master <br> 
  Cost: |20900| Normal <br> 
Notable cards: teacher, flag, going viral, mascot <br> 
Game plan: with this deck you have a couple of ways to play. If you get flag with a bunch of 1 drops you pass t1 and swarm them on turn 2 (it gets even better with teacher). If you don't get one try to go for sports tempo curve. Genetic experiment puts additional pressure and teacher helps you flip trades and with going viral provide insane value. Later you can use primeval yeti and swimmer to simply out-tempo your opponent.

  <b> {Z} {BF} (Tempo) </b> <br> 
  By: Zzyzx_Master <br> 
  Cost: |41650| Expensive  <br> 
Notable cards: iti, toxic waste, commander, cowboy <br> 
Game plan: use imps synergy to take over the board. Very important cards to help you do that are toxic waste, well-placed iti and later imp commander. You also have a bunch of support cards to manipulate trades: smoke bomb, area 22, loudmouth. Those also synergize very well with cowboy and commander's ability. Botanist is nice to front iti or cowboy. Pogo and line dancing let you deal more damage, finally maniacal laugh should finish longer games.

<h1> Viral Pirates </h1>

  <b> {Z} {NT} (Tempo/aggro) </b> <br> 
  By: Zzyzx_Master <br> 
  Cost: |28900| Normalish <br> 
Notable cards: headstone carver, swash, flameface, going viral <br> 
Game plan: carver or agressive octo-pult on 1. Then you have variety of 2-costing graves to synergize with carver and confuse your opponent. Same number of options on turn 3. Use grave and pirate synergy to take over the board, support your cards using tricks, especially going viral. Cowboy is your one card finisher and it gets insane value with any of your tricks.
