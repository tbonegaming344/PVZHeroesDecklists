  <b> {Z} {EB} (Aggro) </b> <br> 
  By: Zzyzx_Master <br>
  Cost: |45850| Expensive  <br> 
Notable cards: conman, aerobics, fruitcake <br> 
Game plan: just simply agroo. Literally 75% of your cards are 1 and 2 drops, so you always should have a play and at the same time almost all those cards are tempo treats with potential to do ton of damage each. Quasars give you often useful superpowers. Bungee and fruitcake open you lanes. Then jester and loudmouth are 2 gravestones your opponent can confuse and front wrong minion. Area 22 gives so much value and in case games go longer and you run out of fuel there's emergency maniacal laugh.

<p class="dashed"> 
  <b> {Z} {PB} (Aggro) </b> <br> 
  By: Zzyzx_Master <br> 
  Cost: |66300| Expensive <br> 
Notable cards: bungee, mustache waxer, quasar, duckstache <br> 
Game plan: it's agroo deck that uses potential of crazy package but at the same time mustache synergy: particularly with mustache waxer. On turn 1 it's better to play conman, but on turn 2 you can already start using awesome synergy of mustache waxer with crazy 1-drops: grobber and bungee. Your opponent shouldn't be able to respond to 2/3 or 2/4 and your agressive 1-drop so then you can get more value of synergies: one also really strong is with quasar. Develop your agressive tempo and later evolve duckstache. To finish your opponent teleport viking or just kill them with the help of sugary treat.

  <b> {Z} {SB} (Aggro) </b> <br> 
  By: Zzyzx_Master <br> 
  Cost: |39850| Expensive <br> 
Notable cards: headstone carver, swash, flameface, cowboy <br> 
Game play: typical pirate synergy agroo (agressive tempo?) deck. On turn 1 it's nice to set up carver but just in case you have agroo option - chimney sweep. On next turns you try to get grave and/or curve to get damage and tempo advantage. Stealthy imp and viking while not great cards themselves, they do a ton of damage paired with smoke bomb, bonus attack or sb's sig. Besides that you have cowboy as a more consistent finisher.

  <b> {Z} {NT} (Tempo/aggro) </b> <br> 
  By: Zzyzx_Master <br> 
  Cost: |28900| Normalish <br> 
Notable cards: headstone carver, swash, flameface, going viral <br> 
Game plan: carver or agressive octo-pult on 1. Then you have variety of 2-costing graves to synergize with carver and confuse your opponent. Same number of options on turn 3. Use grave and pirate synergy to take over the board, support your cards using tricks, especially going viral. Cowboy is your one card finisher and it gets insane value with any of your tricks.
