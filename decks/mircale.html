  By: Zzyzx Master <br> 
  Cost: |53200| Expensive <br> 
Notable cards: astro, imitator, pair pearadise, pineclone, dandy <br> 
Game plan: Stall for first couple turns using bblast and ketchup, on right moment you can use primal sunflower to ramp. Try to not ping blockmeter. If you have dandy combo, set up imitator and environment turn ealier, otherwise make pineclone combo. After successful dandy combo finish em with sonic blooms and astros.

  <b> {P} {CC} (Miracle Swarm)</b> <br> 
  By: Zzyzx_Master <br> 
  Cost: |40450| Expensive  <br> 
Notable cards: astro, rings, pod-fighter <br> 
Game plan: On early game against control you pass and wait for combo with pod-fighter or rings. If they develop some tempo you can also develop yours using synergies between swarm, environments and mutation. Against agroo try to not fall behind and answer things using your own cards. On later game either make huge swarm (with or without rings) paired with tempo tricks/environments or finish them with pod-fighter combo.

  <b> {Z} {RB} (Miracle) </b> <br> 
  By: Zzyzx_Master <br> 
  Cost: |57050| Expensive <br> 
Notable cards: teleport, stomadon, trickster <br>
Game plan: You stall for the first turns so it's nice to have one trickster in hand. To help you not fall far behind you have rolling stone, cader and sumo and to develop tempo quicker, use cryo-brain. On turn 5 you either teleport suprise stompadon or play it with manager to get value. Then you protect it and try to get as much value as possible with help of fun-dead-raiser and going viral. If you don't get stompadon and you start to get out-tempo'd use paparazzi-teacher-going viral synergies to also buff your trickster. Finish them with buffed 1-drops and tricksters.
