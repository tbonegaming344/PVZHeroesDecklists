<b>{Z} {EB} (Tempo) Paper22</b> <br>
By: YoYo <br>
Deck Cost:|40,250| Expensive<br>
Notable Card: Newspaper, Area22, and sync swimmer 
Main Goal: Kill your opponent with a huge newspaper in a22, use loudmouth or fruitcake to keep it alive or use sync and copy its huge stats before it dies
</p> <br> <br> <br> <br> 
<h1> Bomb A22 </h1> 
<img src="/duck/bomb22.jpg" alt="DuckÅ› Bomb22 Decklist" width="799" height="710"> 
<p class="dashed">
<b> {Z}[EB](Aggro+Combo) | Bomb 22 </b> <br> 
By: Duck <br> 
Cost:|37,800| Expensive <br>  
Notable cards: bomb, a22, treat, loudmouth, crazy package <br> 
Main Goal : Do a ton of damage with crazy package, treat, loudmouth and a22 to buff zombie and finish op with bomb and binary. This deck is more aggro but less control than Binary 22 so try to win as fast as you can

  <h1> Amazing Deck </h1> 
  <img src="/michael/amazing.jpg" alt="Michael's Amazing Decklist" width="515" height="572"> 
  <p class="dashed"> 
  <b>  {Z} [EB] (Midrange) Amazing Deck </b> <br> 
by Michael, inspirated in Ken Martin <br> 
Cost: |69.750| Expensive <br> 
Notable cards: Gas Giant, Mondo bronto and Quazard <br>

</p> <br> <br> 
<h1> Aggro Swarm </h1> 
<img src="/zzyzxmaster/aggroswarm.jpg" alt="Zzyzx_Master's Aggro Swarm Decklist" width="908" height="926"> 
<p class="dashed"> 
  <b> {Z} {EB} (Aggro) </b> <br> 
  By: Zzyzx<br> Master <br>
  Cost: |45850|<br>  Expensive  <br> 
Notable cards: conman, aerobics, fruitcake <br> 
Game plan: just simply agroo. Literally 75% of your cards are 1 and 2 drops, so you always should have a play and at the same time almost all those cards are tempo treats with potential to do ton of damage each. Quasars give you often useful superpowers. Bungee and fruitcake open you lanes. Then jester and loudmouth are 2 gravestones your opponent can confuse and front wrong minion. Area 22 gives so much value and in case games go longer and you run out of fuel there's emergency maniacal laugh.

<h1> Headache </h1>
<img src="/badorni/headache.jpg" alt="Badorni's Headace New Decklist" width="828" height="907"> 
<p class="dashed">
  <b>{Z} (Midrange) [EB]
Headache/CC hardcounter</b> <br>
By: BADorni, Inspired by crazy meta <br>
Cost: |62.500| Expensive <br> 
Notable cards: Syncronised Swimmer, Area 22, Headhunter <br>
Main Goal: Abuse all the weaknesses of captain combustible. By going hyper aggressive early you force them into a defensive position, while doing lots off bullseye to the plant hero. Use removal cards to increase that damage. With swimmer and area 22 you make it almost impossible to prevent that damage and headhunter turns invincible by both while providing huge bursts of damage.
</p> 
<h1> Control Gargs </h1> 
<img src="/zzyzxmaster/controlgargs.jpg" alt="Zzyzx_Master's Control Gargs Decklist" width="828" height="900"> 
<p class="dashed"> 
<b> {Z} {EB} (Control) </b> <br> 
By: Zzyzx<br> Master <br> 
Cost: |67900| Expensive <br> 
Notable cards: barrel, hunting grounds, gti, gtg <br> 
Game plan: in the first couple of turns you play it as a standard control deck. Then if you have gti or gtg it's nice to set up hunting grounds turn ealier for the synergy. Fireworks and barrel-fm combo are great to guarantee making more gargs. Finally you have gas giant for solid direct damage to face and to provide even more splash.

  <h1> Modded B22 </h1>

      By: Flowerman <br> 
      Deck Cost: |60,950| Expensive <br> 
      Notable Cards: Binary Stars, Area22, and Manical Laugh <br> 
      Main Goal: Put Binary in A22 and win that way or with manical laugh
