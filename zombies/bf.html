      Notable Cards: Raiding Raptor, Laser Base Aplaha, and Chesse Cutter <br>

  <b> {Z} {BF} (Tempo </b> <br> 
  By: Zzyzx<br> Master <br> 
  Cost: |41650| Expensive  <br> 
Notable cards: iti, toxic waste, commander, cowboy <br> 
Game plan: use imps synergy to take over the board. Very important cards to help you do that are toxic waste, well-placed iti and later imp commander. You also have a bunch of support cards to manipulate trades: smoke bomb, area 22, loudmouth. Those also synergize very well with cowboy and commander's ability. Botanist is nice to front iti or cowboy. Pogo and line dancing let you deal more damage, finally maniacal laugh should finish longer games.

<h1> Lockoutn't </h1>
<img src="/badorni/lockoutn't.jpg" alt="Badorni's Lockout Decklist" width="828" height="816">
<p class="dashed"> 
  <b>{Z} (Tempo) [BF]
Lockoutn't </b> <br>
By: BADorni, Inspired by Sushi <br>
Cost: |57.350| Expensive <br>
Notable cards: Cheesecutter, Monkey Smuggler, Area 22, Cryo Yeti <br>
Main Goal: Since we're playing into discordtards, cheesecutter will usually not get fronted. Now we can use that free value to put more extra tempo on the field and prevent their tempo with cyborg. With monkey smuggler you make sure they don't benefit from the blockcharge and potentially bait out some grave removal, which would win them the game later. Finish the game with either a cryo yeti combo, or a combination of strikethrough and frenzy.
