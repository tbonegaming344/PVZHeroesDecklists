  <b> {Z} {SM} (Tempo) </b> <br> 
  By: Zzyzx_Master <br> 
  Cost: |20900| Normal <br> 
Notable cards: teacher, flag, going viral, mascot <br> 
Game plan: with this deck you have a couple of ways to play. If you get flag with a bunch of 1 drops you pass t1 and swarm them on turn 2 (it gets even better with teacher). If you don't get one try to go for sports tempo curve. Genetic experiment puts additional pressure and teacher helps you flip trades and with going viral provide insane value. Later you can use primeval yeti and swimmer to simply out-tempo your opponent.
