  Cost: |28900| Normalish <br> 
Notable cards: headstone carver, swash, flameface, going viral <br> 
Game plan: carver or agressive octo-pult on 1. Then you have variety of 2-costing graves to synergize with carver and confuse your opponent. Same number of options on turn 3. Use grave and pirate synergy to take over the board, support your cards using tricks, especially going viral. Cowboy is your one card finisher and it gets insane value with any of your tricks.
