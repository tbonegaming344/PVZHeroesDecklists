Note: This is the best plant deck in the game, not capping, not joking, we've done all testing necessary to prove this. <br> Please read this writeup: <a href="https://docs.googlecom/document/d/1nNrwVmdGd24_FKfvuaQiZR65w_TGLrr8ARJieoTYINA/edit?usp=sharing"> Please read this writeup </a> <br>

  <b> {P} [SP] (Midrange) Burst More Martin </b> <br> 
By: RCCH and BADorni <br> 
Notable Cards: Reincarnation, Spikeweed Sector <br> 

TIER: Tier 1 somewhere around low/mid <br> 

Reincarnation: <br> 
- Is a 1 drop that trades on turn 1 with Grobber / Con Man / Cheese Cutter / Dog Walker, that's serving the exact same purpose that Galacta-Cactus does already <br> 
- Is not anti-synergetic with FMN so we can run both comfortably since it doesn't kill our own FMN while using it
- Provides potentially volatile topend for Spudow which Spudow lacks due to having crappy late game <br> 
- Saves deckspace on having to shove in late game because it still helps us stall the turn 1 while also patching up the weakness of Spudow being incredibly 3nut reliant, we have more 1 drops but we also have the late game randomness from Reincarnation <br> 
- We can always just wait until Reincarnation highrolls for us and play it when appropriate to do so. <br> 

Why Spikeweed and not Juggernut: <br> 
- Deals with Beastly decks a lot better (hard counters Beastly hunt and also Area 22) essentially Bunnary 22 tech - best counter option vs Bunnary <br> 
- Protects Dinos from chumpers <br> 
- Denies GTI chump value against VRH <br> 
- Spikeweed straight up free trades against things like Grave Robber on the ground before they can attack with potentially Strikethrough rather than Juggernut, so we don't need to setup a Blauncher from the turn before to immediately deny value, it directly hurts minions inside Gravestones. <br> 
- Gets value against decks without Environments since they can't afford to just lose 2 health every time they want to front a Dinos inside Spikeweed <br> 
- However does not do better vs Barrel because free activation altho the Deadbeard usually dies the turn after and can be dealt with immediately due to turn phases being advantageous for us to be able to deal with that happening.
- Although cannot hit face we make our other stuff hit face more by protecting them. <br> 

Note: Matchups not fully tested but Reincarnation is definitely the option better than gaca
