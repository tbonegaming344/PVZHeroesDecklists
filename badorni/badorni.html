 <b> {Z} (Midrange) [NT]
Agor/Aggressive Control</b> <br>
By: BADorni, Inspired by TheRegster, Dozza and Z3ht <br>
Cost: |48.200|Expensive <br>
Notable cards: Black Hole, Ice Pirate, Excavator, Going Viral<br>
Main Goal: Use black hole to mess up any play for the opponent, both slowing them down and preventing them to block your damage. With Multiple graves for each cost you confuse them and make them play into your graves. By freezing and bouncing their plants you slowly build up a bigger and bigger field and finish the opponent with a going viral, or a mixed up gravedigger in the lategame.

clownboss <br> /pineclones comboss<br> 
By: BADorni, Inspired by Sushi and Dozza <br>
Cost: |50.350|Expensive <br>
Notable cards: Bonk choi, Banana Launcher, Pineclones, Repeat Moss <br>
Main Goal: Stall the first few turns through applying own tempo that can't get value traded. Use pineclones to prevent value trading damaged plants and stabilize your field. Finish the opponent with either a pineclone, a rings or a moss combo.
</p> <br>

 <b>  {P} (Control [RS] </b> <br> 
Freal/Heeze
By: BADorni, inspired by RCCH <br> 
Cost: <br> |16.950| <br> Normal 
Notable cards: everything kekw <br> 
Main Goal: The first turn you either completely ignore the zombies play, or reduce its effect with kernel pult. Either play a 3drop after a primal sunflower, a snowdrop combo or a doctor pepper combo for turn two. From turn 3 on Ketchup Mechanics, Rescue Raddish combos and heal/freeze combos will keep you in the game. Finish the opponent with a brainana after your peppers and snowdrops have grown for enough.

<h1> GargBurn But Good</h1>

<p class="dashed"> 
  <b> {Z} (Midrange) [ZM]
Garg burn but good/gargantuan cock but good</b> <br>
By: BADorni, Inspired by being high <br> 
Cost: |35.200| Normalish <br>
Notable cards: Rolling Stone, Black Hole, Gargologist, Knockout <br>
Main Goal: By running z-mech our opponent will mulligan hard for high health, but low attack plants. Abuse that by playing rolling stone and knockout instead of the plumber and fruitcake they were expecting. With black hole you make your removal reach higher attacks too while making it harder to front your burn damage. End the game with a going viral or with your gas giants.
</p> 
<h1> Headache </h1>

  <b>{Z} (Midrange) [EB]
Headache/CC hardcounter</b> <br>
By: BADorni, Inspired by crazy meta <br>
Cost: |62.500| Expensive <br> 
Notable cards: Syncronised Swimmer, Area 22, Headhunter <br>
Main Goal: Abuse all the weaknesses of captain combustible. By going hyper aggressive early you force them into a defensive position, while doing lots off bullseye to the plant hero. Use removal cards to increase that damage. With swimmer and area 22 you make it almost impossible to prevent that damage and headhunter turns invincible by both while providing huge bursts of damage.

<h1> Lockoutn't </h1>

  <b>{Z} (Tempo) [BF]
Lockoutn't </b> <br>
By: BADorni, Inspired by Sushi <br>
Cost: |57.350| Expensive <br>
Notable cards: Cheesecutter, Monkey Smuggler, Area 22, Cryo Yeti <br>
Main Goal: Since we're playing into discordtards, cheesecutter will usually not get fronted. Now we can use that free value to put more extra tempo on the field and prevent their tempo with cyborg. With monkey smuggler you make sure they don't benefit from the blockcharge and potentially bait out some grave removal, which would win them the game later. Finish the game with either a cryo yeti combo, or a combination of strikethrough and frenzy.

<h1> Mid Beans </h1>

Midbeangs/<br> Midrange Bean Rings <br> 
By: BADorni, Inspired by Squeezy and Z3ht <br>
Cost: |58.000|<br> Expensive <br> 
Notable cards: Admiral Navy Bean, Moonbean, Jelly Bean, Onion Rings <br> 
Main Goal: Run over slightly slower opponents with early bean aggression, similar to abeans. If they seem to have the necessary control optiones however, you can also hold these beans and instead start running over the opponent after an onion rings combo. With jelly bean and shrinking violet you take care of any relevant zombies the opponent plays while cool bean neutralizes gravestones.

<h1> Ramp Rings</h1>

  <b>{P} (Midrange) [CZ]
Ramp rings</b> <br>
By: BADorni <br>
Cost: |38.000| Normalish <br>
Notable cards: Twin Sunflower, Moonbean, Onion Rings <br>
Main Goals: Either control the opponent early with your superpowers and defensive plants, or just skip those early turns by ramping. With primal sunflower you can get moonbean early to shuffle more beanstalks into your deck, or heal the damage you took the first turn with ketchup mechanic. With twin sunflower you can get an onion rings by turn 3, or an elderberry. Finish the opponent with strikethrough, bonus attacks and beanstalks.

<h1> T3mpo </h1>

 <b> {P} (Tempo) [SP]</b> <br> 
t3mpo/tempo 3nut <br> 
By: BADorni, inspiration from sushi <br> 
Cost: |52.300|Expensive <br> 
Notable cards: Reincarnation, Banana Launcher, Spikeweed Sector, 3nut <br> 
Main Goal: Start applying tempo early while free trading zombies with photosynthesiser and garlic. Use forget me nuts and photosynthesiser to prevent tricks. Use infinite banana bombs to destroy zombies and spikeweed sector to prevent graves. Sooner or later reincarnation will transform into something good for your lategame, but if not you can also overpower the zombies with a 3nut combo. 
</p> 
<h1> Wooden Burst </h1>

the wodden burst/pea burst</b> <br> 
By: BADorni <br>
Cost: <br> |56.150|Expensive <br>
Notable cards: Torchwood, 3nut <br>
Main Goal:Many one and twodrops apply much early preassure and hunt the opponent down fast. With a 3nut combo you can instantly get 8 damage on the 4th turn to then win with just a single bonus attack. Otherwise you can also 3nut combo later, but bigger, or just win with an amphibious gattling pea
